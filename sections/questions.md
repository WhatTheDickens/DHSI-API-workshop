# Discussion: Research Questions

During the homework, you sought to formulate a research question that could be addressed by data from an API. In coming up with a research question, you considered the following:

- What sort of questions are possible to answer from the data available?
- What will you have to do to work with this data in terms of manipulation, processing, storage, and so on?
- Is this data complete? Does it tell the story it purports to tell?
- Might the research benefit from combining more than one data set?
- Is your research question concrete and specific?
- Is the research question well-scoped? That is, is it possible to make inroads on this question during during the week?

During this discussion session, you will refine your research questions with the group and imagine what form a response to your question might take.
