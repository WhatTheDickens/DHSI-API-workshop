# Collecting and Processing API Data with Requests

Web APIs are tools for making information and application functionality accessible over the internet. In this lesson, you will:

- Use the requests library in Python to communicate with an API
- Explore returned data program
- Parse and clean returned data

This lesson has been adapted from [Creating Web APIs with Python and Flask](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask) by Patrick Smyth,  edited by Brandon Walsh, and reviewed by Ryan Deschamps and Megan Kudzia. This lesson was originally published on [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).
