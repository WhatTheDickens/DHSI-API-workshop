# Why Use APIs as a Researcher?

The primary focus of this lesson is on creating an API, not exploring or using an API that has already been implemented. However, before we start building our own API, it may be useful to discuss how APIs are useful for researchers. In this section, we'll see how APIs can be useful for approaching historical, textual, or sociological questions using a "macroscopic" or "distant reading" approach that makes use of relatively large amounts of information. In doing so, we'll familiarize ourselves with the basic elements of a good API. Considering APIs from the perspective of a user will come in useful when we begin to design our own API later in the lesson.
