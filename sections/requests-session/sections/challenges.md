# Challenges

Now that you've learned a set of techniques for extracting, parsing, exploring, and transforming data, you're probably itching to put them to work. Choose the challenge below that most appeals to you.

## Challenge One

At the [beginning of this session](fires.md), we took a look at the newspaper text search method provided by Chronicling American. The results of that search are somewhat more complicatedâ€”for example, when you load the JSON into a dictionary, the dictionary will have multiple keys. Try using the techniques you've learned to explore a search term that interests you. Refer back to the [earlier section of this session](fires.md) or [read up on the search method in the [Chronicling American documentation](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/) before diving in. Remember to use the requests library, the JSON library, and the `keys()` method while exploring.

## Challenge Two

In the last few sections, we used the REPL to explore data interactively. In this challenge, take the commands we used in the REPL and create a script using the Brackets text editor. The script should do everything, from using a request to extract data from the API all the way to using a list comprehension to pull out titles. 

For extra credit, once you're done, use a redirect (remember the command line session?) to output title data to a file, or use Google to find another way to output data to a file.

## Challenge Three

In the first homework assignment, you researched an API that might contain data of interest to your research. On Day Two, you developed a research question that might be answered with your API. For this challenge, start thinking about [tongiht's homework assignment early](../../homework3.md). You'll be trying to figure out how to access your chosen API from scratch by doing many of the things we've covered in this session. Don't worry if this seems intimidating...we'll be doing more to prepare you this afternoon.
