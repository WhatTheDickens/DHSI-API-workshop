# Why Use APIs as a Researcher?

There are a number of ways that researchers can get their hands on data. Often, data is available for download in a "data dump"â€”this could be a text-based file such as a .csv or .json file or it might be in the form of a database, such as a SQLite .db file or export in the form of SQL statements. However, certain kinds of data can only be found through APIs. Data accessed through APIs tends toward certain categoreis:

- Data that is updated frequently, such as library catalogs or weather reports
- Data that is too large for download, such as data from Twitter or Reddit
- Data that is calculated based on an input that you provide, such as a translation service or genre identification service

While, in these sessions, we frequently frame APIs as mainly about extracting data for use in research, APIs can also be a way to provide or contribute data to others. If you're interested in this aspect of APIs, check out [Creating Web APIs with Python and Flask](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask) on the Programming Historian, which will walk you through creating an API from scratch to share data with others.
