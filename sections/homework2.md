# Homework Two: Develop A Research Question

For this homework, you will sketch out a research question to focus on for the remainder of the week. Ideally, you will strike a balance between application to your actual research and the capabilities and limitations of the API or APIs you've researched.

In formulating your research question, ask yourself:

- What sort of questions are possible to answer from the data available?
- What will you have to do to work with this data in terms of manipulation, processing, storage, and so on?
- Is this data complete? Does it tell the story it purports to tell?
- Might the research benefit from combining more than one data set?
- Is your research question concrete and specific?
- Is the research question well-scoped? That is, is it possible to make inroads on this question during during the week?

Come to day three with a short formulation of your research questionâ€”perhaps one sentence and a few bullet points. 

There will be some opportunity to revise and refine the research question, so dont' feel stuck if there is something else they find they would prefer to pursue.
