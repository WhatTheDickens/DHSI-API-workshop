## Homework: Develop Research Question
Students will sketch out a research question to focus on for the week, putting information about available APIs up against the sort of research they would like to be doing. Things to consider:
- What sort of questions are possible to answer from the data available?
- How to present this research?
- Is this data complete? Does it tell the story it purports to tell? 
- What is useful/interesting about the research question and the possible answer?
- Will the research benefit from combining more than one dataset (a "mashup")?

Students should come to day 3 with a short formulation of their research question (perhaps one sentence and a few bullet points). There will be some opportunity to revise and refine the research question--so students need not feel stuck if there is something else they find they would prefer to pursue.
