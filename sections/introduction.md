# Introduction

This course is aimed at humanities scholars interested in tapping into the data streams and functionality offered by platforms and content providers such as Twitter, Google, and the New York Times. Introduction to APIs will open with the basics of Python, a scripting language widely used in industry and the academy because of its human readability. We will proceed to the fundamentals of working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the most common way to programmatically access web-based services and data. Lessons will cover the fundamentals of programming, the workflow of building a small script/app, accessing data from a variety of sources, and reading technical documentation. The course will be useful for those interested in understanding programming concepts, developing applications, and working with data. Participants will use DH Box, a cloud-based digital humanities laboratory, for their development environment. 

This is a hands-on course. Consider this offering in complement with Fun- damentals of Programming, CloudPowering DH Research, Practical Software Development for Nontraditional Digital Humanities Developers, or Introduction to Data for Digital Humanities Projects; and more!
