## API Presentations

Students will present the questions they've answered from the homework of the previous day, focusing on what data their selected APIs make available, what an API response might look like, and, without going into too much detail, some reasons why the API might be valuable to their research. Other things to highlight could include: methods of access to the API, data format(s), any proprietary considerations (who owns the data?), and other projects/use cases.
