Homework: Research APIs  
For the first homework, participants will explore a list of APIs to see which data sources might interest them. Presenting the API to the class, the student will consider what prompted their research, what resources and documentation are available, and what they might do with the API.

Prepare a brief introduction to the API you have found.
- What is the API?
- Who maintains it?
- What sort of requests are possible?
- How much information can you find on the website?
