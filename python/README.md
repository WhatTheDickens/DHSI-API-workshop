# Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is suitable for a wide variety of core tasks in the digital humanities. Learning Python fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.

This session in Python fundamentals introduces essential computing concepts such as data types, iteration, input/output, control structures, and importing libraries. This lesson also serves as a basis for later learning in areas such as databases, natural language processing, and working with APIs.
