# Getting ready

You've already been introduced to DH Box, a cloud-based digital humanities laboratory that we'll be using for these sessions on APIs. For this section on Python, we'll be writing scripts in the Brackets text editor and running them in the command line.

First log into DH Box using the "log in" button at the top right on [the DH Box website](http://dhbox.org). 

Once logged inâ€”or if you were logged in from a previous sessionâ€”click your username on the top right and select the "Apps" option.

You'll see the different apps in tabs along the top of the browser window, below the purple title bar. Click "Command Line." Once the command line opens, enter the username and password you used to sign up for DH Box.

Once you see the prompt (your username and a `$`) you're in the right place for the next part of this session.
