# Introduction to the Command Line

Think about your relationship with your computer. How do you navigate what is stored on it, or ask it to perform functions? Many of us use screen displays and a cursor to point and click on icons as a way of getting around. That's probably how you opened this web page, or your email this morning. Pointing and clicking relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!"), which is built to make things easier than navigating the big chunks of code that computers run on.

But, if you know the right lexicon, you can talk directly to you computer. The primary way to do this is through the command line, which involves opening the Terminal application in a Mac operating system, and Bash Shell in Windows. In the window that appears, you can use a controlled list of commands to ask your computer to do certain things. For instance, you can write a command that creates a new folder on your desktop, and you'll watch it appear right before your eyes! Command line is just another way of making things happen. And even better: you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.

By the end of the session, you'll be able to navigate your computer, create and manipulate files, and transform text-based data using only commands that you type within the command line. It'll feel like getting superpowers. And importantly, it will prime us to think of text-based interactions with our computers, as a preface to the type of work we'll do with Web APIs.
