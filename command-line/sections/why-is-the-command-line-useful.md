### Why is the command line useful?

At this point you may ask: "plain text sounds all well and good, but why do we need to step away from a point-and-click workflow?" It's a fair question! The command line, as opposed to a GUI, is an environment where we have more minute control over each task we'd like the computer to perform. Instead of ordering a sandwich in a restaurant off the menu, you're stepping into the kitchen. So while there is a learning curve, this technique ultimately lets you get more *done.* 

For instance, the command line allows you to:

- Easily automate tasks, including creating, copying, and converting files.
- Run programs that you write (trust us, you'll be doing this by today's end).
- Access the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.
- Control other computers remotely!

In addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line is really the gateway to learning programming. And it's been right there on your computer this whole time!

What if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now? That's alright! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about **showing information** that the computer has, or **modifying or making** things (files, programs, etc) on the computer. 

In the next section, we'll make this a little more clear by getting started.
