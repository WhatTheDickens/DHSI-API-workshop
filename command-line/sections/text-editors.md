## Text Editors 

### What Is Text?

Regardless of your familiarity with the command line, if you're a humanities scholar, you've got a great toolkit for thinking about the nuance of text. Us instructors, for instance, have studied the history of textuality, including dives into philology, paleography, codicology, or any of the fields [David Greetham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Greetham_(textual_scholar)) lays out in *Textual Scholarship*. And, if we read D. F. McKenzie, we might say that understanding the "sociology of the text," or the means of production and use that surround it, is just as important as the semantic content itself. 

This type of lens really lets us dig into what's important about plain text for computational uses. You'll be typing in plain text when you open Terminal or Bash, because that application is set up to do just that. However, since the command line can actually go through and "read" certain files for you, we want to consider: what type of text is best for a computer (and us!) to read?

Like we mentioned, plain text does not contain hidden formatting, unlike programs like Microsoft Word, Pages, note-taking platforms, and other software. Of course, Microsoft Word *appears* to contain pretty legible text:

But if we look under the hood, and open this Word .docx file in a text editor, it will look something like this:

![Cat Word Doc](CatWordDoc.png)

Now, you're probably not having the easiest time reading that file. So imagine if you ask the command line, your new friend, to try and understand it! Word documents which look like "just words!" are actually comprised of an archive of extensible markup language (XML) instructions that only Microsoft Word can read. But files that store plain text can be opened in many different editors, and can be read within the command line. This functionality becomes key very shortly.

## Text Editors

So, if it's important for us to write in plain text, we need a text editor that allows us to do this. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, which include .txt, .csv, or .md. (Seeing those file extensions is also a good way to determine whether files you already have, or files you want to download, will be suitable for use with command line funcitons). We want to avoid using the oppose of plain text editors, which are known as **rich text editors**, and include extensions .docx or .rtf. Rich text editors will add invisible special characters to your text, like the above visual examples.

There are all sorts of text editors available--some may already be on your computer, like Notepad. The type of text editor you use may depend on your operating system, but there are many that you can download online, including Sublime, Atom, Emacs, Vim, TextWrangler, and more. Choosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality. So while we won't be using a text editor a lot in this tutorial, [more information about text editors](text-editors-ides.md) can be found in the resources at the end of the lessson.
