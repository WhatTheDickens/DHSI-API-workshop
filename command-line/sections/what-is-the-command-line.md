### What is the command line?

The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer. You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them [in the glossary](glossary.md).)

### What does "text-based" mean?

When working with computers, the definition "text-based" is more specific than just typing characters instead of clicking through a GUI. In computational environments, "text" or "plain text" is quite different from words that appear in word processing formats or desktop publishing (things like Microsoft Word, or Google Docs). Word processing formats are software that displays what we want, without showing us the code the computer is reading to render the formatting. Plain text is, like the name suggests, just text without underlying code that changes how it is rendered. 

So, plain text is what we want to use to speak directly to our computers, and also a good idea for storing text in a sustainable format across different operating systems or types of programs.

Let's take a quick moment to discuss text and text editors.
